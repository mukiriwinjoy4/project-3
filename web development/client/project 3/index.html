          Figma: is a designing tool. Figma brings together powerful design
          tools, it has five most important features; 1. frames- they provide
          structured canvas for designing. 2. Layers- they enable you to
          organize a design therefore creating a visual hierachy within your
          project. 3. Selection- allows you to choose and modify specific design
          elements. 4. Styling- empowrs you to create visually stunning and
          cohesive designs.

          ,frames nad tables and save it all in a text file tha any browser can
          read and display.

        <p>
          CSS: Is the cascading style sheet and used to format the layout of the
          webpages. CSS saves a lot of work. with CSS you are able to design
          without affecting the content this is because design is different from
          content.
        </p>

        <p>
          JS: This is used in browsers to build interactive web pages in the
          programmimg language. JS has got two types of data;primitive- they are
          most basic data in the programming language since they only contain a
          single rule. JS is used to reduce load on the server and it is able to
          cut down the time needed for compilation and the non-primitive data.
        </p>
