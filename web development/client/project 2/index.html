      Sophie, an eight-year-old girl in an orphanage, cannot sleep. Looking out
      of her window, she sees a mysterious Giant Man in the street, carrying a
      suitcase and a trumpet. The giant sees Sophie, who tries to hide in bed,
      but the giant picks her up through the window. Sophie is carried to a
      large cave in the middle of a desolate land, where the giant sets her
      down. Believing that he intends to eat her, Sophie pleads for her life,
      but the giant laughs and dismisses the idea. He explains that although
      most giants do eat humans, he does not because he is the Big Friendly
      Giant, or BFG; he had carried Sophie off merely so she would not reveal
      that she had seen a real giant, which would put him at risk of being
      captured for a zoo-exhibit.
