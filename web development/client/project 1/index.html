    <h1>Tale of two cities</h1>
    <!-- subtitle -->
    <h2>by charles Dickens</h2>
    <!-- paragraph -->
    <p>
      It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
      wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
      the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
      Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
      everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
      to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period
      was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
      insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
      degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen
      with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a
      large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both
      countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves
      of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.
